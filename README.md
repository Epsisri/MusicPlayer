# MusicPlayer
15IT322E - Python Programming End Sem Project

## Introduction
  *music.py* is a project made by me, Epsisri Potluri as a part of the Python Programming course at SRM IST. This was made by using the tkinter, os, pygame and mutagen modules.
  The main aim of the project is to develop a basic GUI music player.
  
## Installation(on windows 10)
  *music.py* is to be downloaded along with the _.png_ files, as these are the images of the buttons.
   Make sure that pygame and mutagen are installed on your interpreter, if you do not have them installed, the commands to install them are: *pip install pygame* and *pip install mutagen*.
   
## Using the program
   When the GUI window called music player opens, go to file -> Open, from the dialogue box that opens, browse the files on your PC and select *one* .mp3 or .wav file to play and enjoy your music.
   Follow the above step again to play an other song of your choice.
   
## Acknowlwedgement
   I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr.N.Parthiban for always providing me with words of encouragement while I stumbled through my way while learning Python.
   Special thanks to the youtube channel _buildwithpython_ for the 30 day tutorial in GUI applications.
   The images used for the buttons are from a website called flaticon.com
